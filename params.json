{"name":"Linked List Cycle Detection","body":"# Linked List Cycle Detection\r\nThis project contains a python implementation of various cycle detection algorithms. \r\n\r\nIt also contains test code which creates lists with cycles (hence it doesn't use the default python list implementation), and graphs the efficiency of each algorithm when run against these lists.\r\n\r\n## Project Structure\r\n* LinkedList.py: Contains classes for linked lists and linked list nodes, and an implementation of the cycle detection algorithms.\r\n* GraphPlot.py: contains functions needed to plot the test data (as illustrated above). This calls the LinkedList class to generate lists with cycles, and runs a specified set of algorithms against each list.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n* Python 1.7\r\n* [MatPlotLib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/), which requires [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)","tagline":"A Comparison of Cycle Detection Algorithms","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
