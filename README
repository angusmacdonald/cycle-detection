This project contains a python implementation of linked list that allows for cycles to be created (hence it doesn't use the default python list implementation). 

It allows for these algorithms to be tested by generating a specified number of lists and graphing the number of iterations each algorithm required to find a cycle. 

There are two classes:
• LinkedList: Contains classes for linked lists and linked list nodes, and an implementation of the cycle detection algorithms.
• GraphPlot: contains functions needed to plot the test data (as illustrated above). This calls the LinkedList class to generate lists with cycles, and runs a specified set of algorithms against each list.

The solution has the following dependencies:
• Python 1.7
• Matlibplot (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/), which requires numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org/)
